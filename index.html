<p>Summer Project in conjunction with MGWU
A mixture of tetris and BubblePop, throw special fruits down to smash other fruits before they reach the top! Rocks spawn and block your fruits from destroying the other fruit, so you have to clear the rocks with their resepctive fruits. Each fruit has their special resepctive powers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strawberry: Can pierce any rock and destroy it.</li>
<li>Blueberry: Destroys the first type of fruit it touches on the screen.</li>
<li>Watermelon: Destroys all fruit in its path.</li>
<li>Pear: Freezes all fruit in place temporarily.</li>
<li>Grape: Converts fruit into a explosive gem.</li>
<li>Banana: TBD</li>
</ul>

<p>Complete with particle effects, tutorials, and 5 unique fruits.</p>

<p>This project was my gateway into iOS development. I spent many tireless nights looking up the Cocos2D API, learning how to use the many functions that would add to my game. My favorite part about my project are the animations, as they make the game feel fluid and polished. Unfortunately the gameplay is extremely difficult to balance and make fun, but I am working on it as I speak.</p>

<p>I discovered something about myself while working on this project: I love design. I like to make things look nice and pretty and if its disproportionally ugly I will do all that I can to make it pretty. I also discovered how quickly I was able to pick up the language, despite it being my first time going through objective-C. I learned by doing and experimenting, and while I did receive a lot of help from my peers, I generally found the patterns and was able to work fluidly on my project after a few weeks.</p>

<p>In the end, this isn't a game that will make me rich, but it a nice practice project for my future projects.</p>
